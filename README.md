While working on the lab, I forgot to save all the commits before commiting and pushing and ended up with a bunch of empty files except for the screenshots which i saved before committing. Talked to 
a TA and tutor Shravi Jain and they confirmed it was ok to repush the changes without penalty. In the "write.png" file, I included a screenshot that shows contents of a .md file with a lastwritetime of before the deadline to prove that
everything was written but never saved before pushing.
